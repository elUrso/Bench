Bench Table Format

make option that i was looking for is: -s, --silent, --quiet

BTS is based in the json format

Each run of a program shall output a json with the following structure:

{
    "bench" : "$NAME",
    "id" : "$ID"
    "mode" : "(seq, omp, oss, pth, opt, ...)",
    "args" : "-i 20",
    "time" : 123 [ms],
    "task_size" : [ tasks ]?
    ]
}

If a benchmak contains multiple runs, it shall output with the following structure:

{
    "out" : [
        <run>...
    ]
}

For easier implementation, the user can user the bench API written in c.
